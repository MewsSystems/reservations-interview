## Task Report

_give an indication where you spent your time and on which tasks, if your commit history is an accurate timelog you can talk about
that, two examples are below._

_The commit log is an accurate representation of my time spent from first commit, and it shows I did the MVP of RE#001,
then RE#004, then RE#003, then committed the polish for RE#001, and then the polish of RE#003, and did
some overall tidying after that. The commit log shows a time of 95 minutes and there was roughly 15 minutes of
work prior to the first commit._

_I took the full 120 minutes, with most of my time spent on #1 and #3._
