## Featured Room

Currently our rooms have our standard picture (see ./ui/public/bed.png), but guests seeing
our rooms should see specific pictures and highlights.

Guests should see a featured room with a unique picture when booking.

- The system must support rooms having a unique picture
- The system must support a room being marked as featured
- The UI must show a featured room in a new hero section on the booking screen
- Staff should be able to manage rooms and their pictures
- Staff should be able to select a room to feature
- The system should support adding a list of amenities to a room
- The UI should highlight a list of amenities in an eye-catching way
