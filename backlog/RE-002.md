## Staff Check Ins

Staff must be able to check in Guests.

- Staff must be able to view bookings.
- Staff must be able to check guests in, marking the room as currently occupied.
- Access must be restricted to only Staff with an Access Code.
  - Simple shared access code is for simplicity and time, feel free to propose more sophisticated authentication,
    an implementation of this has been provided in `/staff/login` and `/staff/check`.
- Staff should be able to search and/or find bookings by rooms, by a 'today' quick filter, so that staff can
  efficiently check-in and check-out guests.
- Staff should be able to find guests by email for upcoming bookings so they can send emails of upcoming stays
  for upsell opportunities and building rapport and long term relationships with guests.
